## About

### Description and Purpose

BookEZ is an easy-to-use online booking platform designed specifically for nail salons. It simplifies the appointment scheduling process for both customers and salon staff. With features like user authentication, browsing available salons, selecting preferred nail technicians, and booking appointments, BookEZ ensures a smooth and personalized experience. The application aims to streamline salon operations by automating appointment management and providing clear communication between salons and their clients.

### Inspiration

The idea for BookEZ came from the challenges many people face when booking appointments at their favorite nail salons. Often, scheduling is done over the phone or through manual systems, leading to double bookings, missed appointments, and confusion. BookEZ was inspired by the need for a more efficient, user-friendly solution that allows customers to easily browse salons, select their preferred technicians, and secure their desired time slots with just a few clicks. It also helps salons by reducing administrative tasks.
